    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p><Strong><em>Sinigang</em></Strong>, sometimes anglicized as <strong>sour broth</strong>, is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with tamarind (Filipino: <em>sampalok</em>), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent such as unripe mangoes or rice vinegar. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine. This soup, like most Filipino dishes, is usually accompanied by rice.</p>
